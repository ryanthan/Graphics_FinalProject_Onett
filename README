CSCI4229 - Fall 2020 - Final Project

This project is a 3D recreation of the town Onett from the 1995 role-playing game Earthbound.

Notes:
  - The program can be run simply by compiling with make and executing the file with .\final.exe
  - Time spent on this project so far: 65+ hours
  - Please look at the provided onett.png to see the original reference.
  - The entire town can be examined from orthogonal/perspective views.
        - For a closer look at the details on each object, the town can be fully explored in first person or viewed by separate sections.
  - Almost every object in the scene has been meticulously converted from 2D sprites to 3D, textured (over 100 textures in total), and detailed by hand.
  - Many objects (cars, buildings, houses, etc.) have different colors, textures, and other unique details.
  - Several transparent textures such as plants, flowers, and weathervanes serve to add more detail to the scene.
  - The addition of a skybox adds immersion to the scene.
  - Some of the cars in the town drive around the streets on their own.

Code Reuse and References:
  - Any functions reused from previous homeworks or class examples are noted in the code comments.
  - To create a hollow hemisphere, I referred to this website: https://users.cs.jmu.edu/bernstdh/web/common/lectures/summary_opengl-texture-mapping.php
    and this website: https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl2.1/xhtml/glClipPlane.xml
  - I got almost all of my textures from: https://www.textures.com/ and got the texture for my skybox from: https://www.humus.name/index.php?page=Textures&start=0
  - I got help with the image transparency from Professor Schreuder and the lecture example shown on November 12.
